        =============
        DOMAIN_CONFIG
        =============

        The expectations for the "domain_config" parameter follow.  This will cover both the initial
        configuration (that is passed to add_domain) as well as any rules about reconfiguration of
        an existing domain.

        What is a Domain?  It is technically the VM instances out there running that make up a logical
        group of entities doing "something" together.

        To "reconfigure" a domain is technically to change the configuration here in the EPUM service
        (the control plane) which may have ramifications on what a particular domain's constituent
        parts end up being.

        When we refer to a domain vs. another, in most systems the main distinguishing thing is
        the *type* of VM instances that are being launched.  A "deployable type" is a VM image that
        is launched with specific configuration values and 'recipes' to instantiate it.

        In more advanced systems, the distinguishing feature is also the particular client (whose
        identity is verified in the messaging layer appropriate way).  There may be many different
        clients using the same EPUM service to launch many applications across many IaaS clouds.
        TODO: This is not currently implemented.

        A domain's configuration is broken down into the following key sections:

        * GENERAL
        * ENGINE CONF
        * HEALTH

        The entire configuration is a dict.  Each section has a corresponding key.  Which is a
        reference to a dict.  Each of which are discussed below.

        The string values mentioned below are constants defined in "epu.epumanagement.conf"

        GENERAL
        =======

        KEY: "general"

        DICT:
          *  "engine_class": Fully qualified name to the decision engine to use, which is what
             controls compensation behavior at a fine grained level.  If this key is missing, the
             decision engine will be the default one: epu.decisionengine.impls.simplest.SimplestEngine

        An engine class cannot currently be reconfigured.  It is fairly doable though, consider
        that the entire engine and configuration needs to be reconstituted after a decider leader
        change anyhow.


        ENGINE CONF
        ===========

        KEY: "engine_conf"

        This entire structure is passed into the decision engine implementation class.
        The configuration expectations are listed per decision engine, see the default one:
        epu.decisionengine.impls.simplest.SimplestEngine

        An engine reconfiguration does not happen immediately, it happens when the decider
        role becomes aware of a configuration change.


        HEALTH
        ======

        KEY: "health"

        DICT:
          *  "monitor_health": True or False
             If this is false, health monitoring is disabled and none of the other configurations
             in the health section are relevant.
          *  "boot_timeout": integer
             If present, number of seconds to wait for a "started" VM to become contextualized
             before declaring it hung.  Sometimes VMs start but have problems even contacting
             the context broker to report a contextualization error.
             If configuration is not present, the default is 300 seconds.
          *  "missing_timeout": integer
             If present, number of seconds to allow to elapse between VM heartbeats before
             declaring it corrupted.
             If configuration is not present, the default is 120 seconds.
          *  "zombie_seconds": integer
             If present, number of seconds to allow termination to occur.  VM instances may be
             in the TERMINATING state as far as the EPUM is concerned but may still be sending
             heartbeats.  After this period of time elapses and we are still receiving heartbeats,
             another termination request is sent.
             If configuration is not present, the default is 120 seconds.
