    One instance state object. This object is considered immutable and is
    replaced, not changed. As new information is received about an instance,
    the existing Instance object is copied and new information is added. This
    updated object will be available to the decision engine at the next
    decide() call.

    This object exposes many values as attributes, not a fixed set.
    The following will be always be available and will never change:
        instance_id - unique identifier for instance
        launch_id - unique identifier for the instance's launch group
        site - deployment-specific IaaS site id; corresponds to DT sites
        allocation - deployment-specific IaaS allocation (small, large, etc)

    The following attributes will always be available but may change in future
    objects for an instance:
        state - the instance IaaS state; one of epu.states.InstanceHealthStates
        state_time - the time the current IaaS state was received by the
                     controller
        health - the instance's health state; one of
                 epu.states.InstanceHealthState

    The following attributes will be available no later than the instance's
    REQUESTED state, but may be available earlier. They are not guaranteed to
    ever exist on instances that do not reach this state. For example,
    instances that fail to resolve in the DTRS may never have these attributes.
        ctx_name - the name of the instance group in the DT contextualization
                   document
        iaas_image - the IaaS-specific instance image name (ami-XXXXXXXX, etc)
        iaas_allocation - the IaaS-specific instance allocation size (m1.small)
        iaas_sshkeyname - the IaaS-specific SSH key name, if applicable

    The following attributes will be available no later than the instance's
    STARTED state, but may be available earlier. They are not guaranteed to
    ever exist on instances that do not reach this state. For example,
    instances that fail immediately may never have been assigned an IP.
        public_ip - the public IP or hostname of the instance
        private_ip - the private IP or hostname of the instance

    The set of available properties can be found with items(), iteritems(),
    keys(), etc. These methods behave like that of a dict. Attempting to get
    an nonexistent property will return None.
